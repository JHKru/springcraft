# sENM_13 Dehoucl-Mikhailov parameters for amino acid interactions
# Reference: Dehouck Y, Mikhailov AS (2013) PLOS Computational Biology 9(8): e1003209. 
# Shape: 20x20
# AA interaction matrix computed with a cutoff of 13 Angstrom
# --> residues separated by a distance > 13 Ang. are not interacting
# Important: Zero entries in last distance bin -> [16.5, inf]
# Note:  Bonded interactions are described with a larger value of the spring constant (gamma = 10.00)
#             10 x Mean(AA_interaction_matrices)_@3.5 Angstrom
